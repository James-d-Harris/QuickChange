# Analysis

## 1. System Description


In an increasingly digital world, the ability to understand and use physical money is at risk of becoming a less common skill for elementary school **students**. The potential impacts of this include lack of math proficiency and the development of counting skills, critical thinking, and the ability of recognizing patterns. 
For kids that have trouble counting change or for elementary schools and online learning platforms that want to access a hands-on learning environment for counting change, QuickChange is an educational game that teaches kids the value of money. Unlike other learning platforms like Kahn Academy and ABC Mouse, our product engages **students** with a user experience centered around practical and real world scenarios. QuickChange is an educational game that teaches kids how to count money in the most accurate and efficient way by introducing the **student** to a real world learning environment.

QuickChange will allow **students** and **teachers** to create respective personal accounts. The **student** account will store **student's** progress, while the **teacher** account will be responsible for ***tracking the progress*** of each **student**. The content of this game will teach **students** how to count change by generating random values to be operated on in each **level**. The **difficulty** of each problem will ***rise or fall*** (automatically or at **teachers** descretion) depending on the **students** performance in the prior **level**. In order to enhance the learning experience, **students** will be provided with feedback on each problem, and have the ability of altering QuickChange's styling to accomodate visual disabilities. All **student** and **teacher** accounts will be retrievable with valid username and password

The gameplay of QuickChange will consist of having **students** ***interact*** with npc **customers**. Each **customer** will ***generate*** it's own randomized **item** and value of **currency** to be used in each problem. Students will then be navigated to the **register**, where they will ***calculate*** the difference between the customer *tender* and owed *balance*. The student will then distribute change by ***dragging*** out different types of **currency** out of the **register** such as coins and bills. The *value* pulled out of register will appear on the **coin sum display** and be used to check work and provide feedback.
