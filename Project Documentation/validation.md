## 1. Introduction

QuickChange is an educational game that teaches kids how to count money in the most accurate and efficient way by introducing the student to a real world learning environment.

The main features of our game include a: 

- Login scene that allows students to login and store their game data.
- Teacher login scene that allows admin to view their progress.
- A store scene that includes a register, customers, and items to purchase. Here is where students can interact with money and customers to get a feel for a real world learning environment.

### Interview Results

1. Tatum Rosello

    - Gameplay:

        - How does the game look?

            - The store scene looks cartoon-y and the colors are bright. The register reminds me of Papa's Pizzeria a little.

        - What do you think of the register UI and menu screens?

            - They were simple and easy to use. All I had to do was click on "Login" to login and "Exit" to logout. The register display screen didn't change as I moved the change around.

        - Do you feel the game was interactive and entertaining?

            - Yes.

        - Rate the difficulty of playing from 1-10.

            - 3

        - Were the game mechanics easy to understand and use?

            - Yes. I liked that the coins followed my mouse and snapped into place. I didn't have to use the keyboard unless logging in, so I could see kids using their tablets to play.

        - Was the objective of the game clear?

            - Not really. I know because you told me, but handing the changes to Obama when he's suppose to be paying for his item was confusing. I think a validation or confirmation screen should be added to really tell the user they were successful or unsuccessful.

        - What could we improve moving forward?

            - Adding that validation screen, maybe some more level designs or item choices, and a tutorial for the kids.

    - Usage: 

        - Would you use this game, and in what environment?

            - I would totally use this game in my classroom as a student teacher. My kids love playing games, and because they each have their own tablet I think it could make for a fun lesson.

        - Would you recommend this game to others?

            - Yes, I would recommend this game to by boss and the other student teachers I work with.

        - Who do you think could benefit most from this game?

            - I think kids that have ADD or ADHD or special needs could really learn from this type of game. From what I see, they love being on their tablets or learning with the Smartboard in class.

        - Does the game feel fun and educational simultaneously?

            - Yeah I think it does. If anything, it feels more like a game. I would maybe add little help or tip boxes that could be used to teach kids in the spur of the moment if you wanted to build on the educational aspect.

        - How long would you or your kids spend playing?

            - If there were more than one level, I could definitely make an entire lesson out of it. That would be a little under an hour I guess.

    - Inception Follow-ups

        - Are real-life money skills adequately covered in the game?

            - Yes and no. The interaction between the customer and employee is covered, but as far as the actually change being given back, I think it could use some work. Maybe adding a follow along screen to show the optimal amount of change, or changing the register display to help the kids count could really help.

        - What other kinds of level designs or environments would you like to see?

            - I think the store scene is really cool, adding more items to buy would also be nice. I think an additional level should be food related, like McDonalds or the cafeteria so the kids can relate.
