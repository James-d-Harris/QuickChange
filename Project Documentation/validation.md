## 1. Introduction

QuickChange is an educational game that teaches kids how to count money in the most accurate and efficient way by introducing the student to a real world learning environment.

The main features of our game include a: 

- Login scene that allows students to login and store their game data.
- Teacher login scene that allows admin to view their progress.
- A store scene that includes a register, customers, and items to purchase. Here is where students can interact with money and customers to get a feel for a real world learning environment.

### Interview Results

1. Tatum Rosello

    - Gameplay:

        - How does the game look?

            - The store scene looks cartoon-y and the colors are bright. The register reminds me of Papa's Pizzeria a little.

        - What do you think of the register UI and menu screens?

            - They were simple and easy to use. All I had to do was click on "Login" to login and "Exit" to logout. The register display screen didn't change as I moved the change around.

        - Do you feel the game was interactive and entertaining?

            - Yes.

        - Rate the difficulty of playing from 1-10.

            - 3

        - Were the game mechanics easy to understand and use?

            - Yes. I liked that the coins followed my mouse and snapped into place. I didn't have to use the keyboard unless logging in, so I could see kids using their tablets to play.

        - Was the objective of the game clear?

            - Not really. I know because you told me, but handing the change to Obama when he's suppose to be paying for his item was confusing. I think a validation or confirmation screen should be added to really tell the user they were successful or unsuccessful.

        - What could we improve moving forward?

            - Adding that validation screen, maybe some more level designs or item choices, and a tutorial for the kids.

    - Usage: 

        - Would you use this game, and in what environment?

            - I would totally use this game in my classroom as a student teacher. My kids love playing games, and because they each have their own tablet I think it could make for a fun lesson.

        - Would you recommend this game to others?

            - Yes, I would recommend this game to my boss and the other student teachers I work with.

        - Who do you think could benefit most from this game?

            - I think kids that have ADD or ADHD or special needs could really learn from this type of game. From what I see, they love being on their tablets or learning with the Smartboard in class.

        - Does the game feel fun and educational simultaneously?

            - Yeah I think it does. If anything, it feels more like a game. I would maybe add little help or tip boxes that could be used to teach kids in the spur of the moment if you wanted to build on the educational aspect.

        - How long would you or your kids spend playing?

            - If there were more than one level, I could definitely make an entire lesson out of it. That would be a little under an hour I guess.

    - Inception Follow-ups

        - Are real-life money skills adequately covered in the game?

            - Yes and no. The interaction between the customer and employee is covered, but as far as the actual change being given back, I think it could use some work. Maybe adding a follow along screen to show the optimal amount of change, or changing the register display to help the kids count could really help.

        - What other kinds of level designs or environments would you like to see?

            - I think the store scene is really cool, adding more items to buy would also be nice. I think an additional level should be food related, like McDonalds or the cafeteria so the kids can relate.

2. Abby Timonen

    - Gameplay:

        - How does the game look?

            - A little bland and confusing. I'm not sure if I'm inside or outside or on a busy street. I think if you're going for a grocery store look, add some more registers, some shelves in the back, and some products on the shelves.

        - What do you think of the register UI and menu screens?

            - I like the aspect of the register UI and the idea that it can keep track of the amount of change necessary to give. It could really help the younger kids who have trouble with decimals. 

        - Do you feel the game was interactive and entertaining?

            - Yes.

        - Rate the difficulty of playing from 1-10.

            - 5

        - Were the game mechanics easy to understand and use?

            - Yes.

        - Was the objective of the game clear?

            - The idea of the objective was clear, but it's not actually there in the game. There are a few things missing like the exchange of goods and some way to tell the kids if they're right or wrong.

        - What could we improve moving forward?

            - Adding at least something to the setting in the menu screen would be cool, even if it's just brightness or something like that. Also adding multiple customers per level so kids can get a chance to get the problem right without restarting the entire game. 

    - Usage: 

        - Would you use this game, and in what environment?

            - I would play this by myself if more levels were added, but right now I would use it for the kids I do one-on-one time with during math lessons.

        - Would you recommend this game to others?

            - Yes, I'm going to tell my practicum teacher about it actually.

        - Who do you think could benefit most from this game?

            - Elementary-age kids, mainly kindergarten through fifth grade.

        - Does the game feel fun and educational simultaneously?

            - Yeah, I think that kids can learn how to use money in a grocery store and still have fun because of the silly characters and colors. Really kids just like any game or screen time they get.

        - How long would you or your kids spend playing?

            - With just the one level, maybe 5 or 10 minutes.

    - Inception Follow-ups

        - What other kinds of level designs or environments would you like to see?

            - I had mentioned when you first interviewed me that I would've liked an Amazon type environment. However, looking at the game now that doesn't make a lot of sense, but I think a restaurant, bank, or video game store would appeal to the kids. 

        - Are the menu screens simple to understand and do you feel they provide easy access to kids?

            - The menu screen is easy to understand and most of the buttons work. I do want to see some work done with the settings button to allow for more accessibility (color blind mode, maybe text-to-speech).

        - Are the gameplay, background, and assets attention-grabbing and entertaining?

            - The gameplay is simple and interactive. I like the coin movement and that the customer is Obama. The background is a little bland and doesn't really look like a store. It kind of looks like you set up shop on the side of the street behind some windows.

3. Thelma Davis

    - Gameplay:

        - How does the game look?

            - Looks cartoony and kindof childish in a good way. I think it would be entertaining, but only to younger kids.

        - What do you think of the register UI and menu screens?

            - It looks easy to use and helpful, serves it's purpose but looks a little minimalist.

        - Do you feel the game was interactive and entertaining?

            - Yea but just for younger kids.

        - Rate the difficulty of playing from 1-10.

            - 4

        - Were the game mechanics easy to understand and use?

            - Yea it's super easy to understand. I like that there is something that keeps track of the money pulled out.

        - Was the objective of the game clear?

            - It's almost kind of self-explanatory, but I can see some little kids not getting it at first.

        - What could we improve moving forward?

            -  Maybe adding some instructions. And decorating the store more.

    - Usage: 

        - Would you use this game, and in what environment?

            - As an adult, I personally wouldn't use it.

        - Would you recommend this game to others?

            - Yea I'd recommend this game to parents of children that seem to struggle with math. Or if parents just want something constructive for their kids to do.

        - Who do you think could benefit most from this game?

            - Kids, or maybe tutors or teachers.

        - Does the game feel fun and educational simultaneously?

            - Yes, seems entertaining to be something that teaches math.

        - How long would you or your kids spend playing?

            - If there are other levels, I can see a kid being entertained for a good 15-30 minutes.

    - Inception Follow-ups

        - What other kinds of level designs or environments would you like to see?

            - A different store, or other customers than Obama.

        - Are the menu screens simple to understand and do you feel they provide easy access to kids?

            - Yea, I think they are simple and pretty straight-forward.

        - Are the gameplay, background, and assets attention-grabbing and entertaining?

            - Yea it all seems like it would keep a kids attention.
        
        - Are real-life money skills adequately covered in the game?
          
            - Yes but in a very simple way, teaches good core foundations for kids to know.

### Reflection

From the interviews above, we as a team learned what our users liked, what they didn't like, what can be changes, and what went as expect/unexpected. 

As far as the actual gameplay goes, our three follow up interviewees all enjoyed the cartoonish look and bright colors in the store. They said that the register and menu UI screen were fun and interactive, and the game was easy to play and understand the goal of it. Some feedback we received about the gameplay was to add a validation screen to alert users when a level is over, and add additional settings such as colorblind mode or text-to-speech.

When asking our users about the usage of the game, we had some conflicting results. As of right now, we only have one level design inside of Unity, and teachers and students alike said that because of this they wouldn't play for prolonged periods of time. If we could expound upon our current design, two student teachers we followed up with said they would recommend this system to their colleagues. Regardless of level design right now though, the target audience remains the same; elementary-aged children.

When asked about what specific level designs we could implement, a follow-up question from our [Inception](https://github.com/James-d-Harris/QuickChange/blob/main/Project%20Documentation/inception.md) interviews, our users said things like a cafeteria, bank, or video game store, all places where kids can relate to in some way. Our biggest question was "are real-life money skills adequately covered," and again we recieved conflicting answers. Themla and Tatum both initially said yes, but highlighted that our current system is very simple and could benefit from some new features. Some features they mentioned were instructions on how to play the game and a screen that counts up to the correct amount of change to be given back.

Overall, our users' actions did not produce the exact results we expected, but their feedback was immesnly helpful. They were able to find bugs and raise concern about areas of the game that might cause trouble for the children, the game mechanics for example. On top of that, they had given us new insight on how to improve and expound upon our MVP by adding tutorials or multiple custoemrs per level to boost retention rates. With that being said, we still believe that our initial value proposition was accomplished, as we provided an application designed to prepare young minds for real-world transactions with easy, engaging financial education.
