## 3. Testing

## 4. Demo

## 5. Code Quality

As a team, we decided that the best way to manage out code quality was to use a C# Linter. Since we had worked with command line linters in CS 386 a few weeks prior, we wanted to work with something similar for C#. We landed on dotnet-format, a command line tool to check and fix code style and formatting issues.

The dotnet-format linter follows the common C# code conventions as posted here: [C# Code Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions).
