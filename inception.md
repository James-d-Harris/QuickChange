## 1. Introduction:
In an increasingly digital world, the ability to use physical money is at risk of becoming a less common skill. But, why not use this technological revolution to our advantage and get the best of both worlds? Thus, the idea for QuickChange was conceptualized. QuickChange is an educational application designed to help young individuals learn how to calculate change using virtual legal tender. The goal is to provide a fun and interactive experience to teach basic financial literacy concepts, including subtraction, counting in different bases, and multiplication with money.

**When:** September 19, 2024\
**Customer Segments:** Substitute Teacher

**Key Insights:**
- Believes that 1st and 2nd graders would not be capable of advance mathematics such as adding and subtracting items at the same time. They should be limited to one or the other. However, 3rd and 4th graders would be capable of these advanced concepts.

### Interview 7:
**Summary:** Tatum is an Early Elementary Education Major who graduates this winter. For the past two years, Tatum has been a Teacher Aide at Knoles Elementary School, helping with before and after school activities. She also sits in on an elementary school class one day a week.\
**Interviewer:** Tate\
**Interviewee:** Tatum Rosello\
**When:** September 18, 2024\
**Customer Segments:** Early Elementary Grade Teachers

**Key Insights:**
- When it comes to teaching the concept of money, I've seen teachers more often use manipulatives (physical objects) so kids can develop an understanding between the monetary value and the physical appearance.
- There are kids who struggle to use a computer at a young age.

**Representative Quotes:**
- "A lot of teachers prefer teaching electronically, just because that's the direction education seems to be headed."

**Assessments (Must have / Nice to have / Don't care):**
- When asked about the use of our proposed technology, she said it was a “Nice to have” because it allows kids to learn real life money skills while also interacting with computers, which is using technology in the classroom most teachers support. Something that would make it a "Must have" is a way to incorporate physical dollars and cents, even if it's just an actual image, anything would help. Another "Must have" would be a tutorial in the beginning demonstrating how to use the software for those kids who struggle with technology.

### Interview 8:
**Summary:** Abby Timonen is an Education Major at NAU. This semester, Abby started in NAU's Practicum program. Over the course of the next few terms, she'll progressively develop new teaching skills and assume more responsibilities within the classroom.\

**Key Insights:**
- The prototype for the UI looks engaging for kids.
- Real world scenarios like grocery shopping or Amazon shopping could be interesting.

**Representative Quotes:**
- "I know that the kids I work with always get excited when we get to use iPads or the touchscreen whiteboard, so I think they'll be excited just to use the computer if they were to play your game."

**Assessments (Must have / Nice to have / Don't care):**
- Abby said that she really like the idea for the project and it would be "Nice to have" in her classroom. It provides an opportunity for kids to be independent while working and would probably keep them entertained. A "Must have" that Abby mentions would be different level designs to make sure her kids don't get bored or not engage in the game.

### Interview 9:
**Summary:** Christina Kelley is a teacher at Breakthrough Academy in Phoenix Arizona. Breakthrough Academy works with children with disabilities that are in grade school.\
**Interviewer:** Tre\
**Interviewee:** Christina Kelley\
**When:**
**Customer Segments:** Special Needs Teachers

**Key Insights:**
- There should be an easy access way to see what each piece of change looks like and is worth, especially in context to what shows the kid how much change they need.
- She also suggested that we get the kids attention by awarding them with bright colorful figurines.
- Suggested that maybe there could be seasonal content to grab attention, like Santa as a customer, or people buying Halloween candy.

**Representative Quotes:**

**Assessments (Must have / Nice to have / Don't care):**
