## 1. Positioning - Dazzion

### 1.1 Problem Statement
### 1.2 Product Position Statement
### 1.3 Value Proposition and Customer Segment

## 2. Stakeholders - Tre

### List of stakeholders in order of control over the product
1.	Our group of developers: We are a user which in this case would manage the distribution of our program and who has access to the managerial side of the content.
2.	Teachers and school faculty: This group would have access to the software and the ability to manage which of their students have access to it and the ability to track progress of those students.
3.	Students and Other Children Learning: This group would be the one using the main part of the program to learn with. They would be the group interacting with the game/learning experience.

## 5. Minimial Viable Product (MVP) - James

### 5.1 Our MVP
Our MVP will showcase the core gameplay mechanics of QuickChange. While it won't include certain advanced features like account saving, progress review, or difficulty scaling, it will clearly demonstrate the game's objectives and the financial literacy skills we're aiming to teach.

### 5.2 Features
The core features we will validate in our MVP are:

1. **Request of currency:** A customer requests a specific amount of change from the player.
2. **Selecting currency:** The player selects coins or bills to provide the requested change.
3. **Displaying the total sum:** A real-time display shows the total sum of the selected currency.
4. **User submission:** The player submits their selected currency when they believe they have provided the correct amount.
5. **Validation:** The system checks whether the total sum matches the requested amount.

These five features form the core mechanics of QuickChange and clearly illustrate our goals of teaching users how to calculate and provide the correct amount of change.

### 5.3 Validation Strategy
To validate these features, we will conduct playtesting sessions where users interact with the core mechanics of the game. We will assess the following:

- **User Engagement:** Observe how easily users understand the request and selection of currency mechanics, ensuring the gameplay is intuitive.
- **Accuracy of Submissions:** Analyze how often users are able to correctly provide the requested amount of currency and how long it takes them.
- **Feedback Collection:** Gather qualitative feedback from users on their experience, particularly regarding ease of use and areas of confusion.
- **Iterative Improvements:** Based on user feedback, we will refine the interface and game mechanics to make QuickChange more accessible and engaging before expanding to additional features.

By focusing on these key metrics, we will be able to ensure the core gameplay mechanics are effectively teaching users how to calculate change, aligning with the goals of the application.
