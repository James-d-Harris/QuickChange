# Analysis

## 1. System Description


In an increasingly digital world, the ability to understand and use physical money is at risk of becoming a less common skill for elementary school kids. The potential impacts of this include lack of math proficiency and the development of counting skills, critical thinking, and the ability of recognizing patterns. 
For kids that have trouble counting change or for elementary schools and online learning platforms that want to access a hands-on learning environment for counting change, QuickChange is an educational game that teaches kids the value of money. Unlike other learning platforms like Kahn Academy and ABC Mouse, our product engages students with a user experience centered around practical and real world scenarios. QuickChange is an educational game that teaches kids how to count money in the most accurate and efficient way by introducing the student to a real world learning environment.
