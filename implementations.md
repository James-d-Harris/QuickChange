## Introduction
QuickChange is an educational game that teaches kids how to count money in the most accurate and efficient way by introducing the student to a real world learning environment.

QuickChange will allow students and teachers to create respective personal accounts. The student account will store student's progress, while the teacher account will be responsible for tracking the progress of each student. The content of this game will teach students how to count change by generating random values to be operated on in each level. The difficulty of each problem will rise or fall (automatically or at teachers descretion) depending on the students performance in the prior level. In order to enhance the learning experience, students will be provided with feedback on each problem, and have the ability of altering QuickChange's styling to accomodate visual disabilities. All student and teacher accounts will be retrievable with valid username and password

The gameplay of QuickChange will consist of having students interact with npc customers. Each customer will generate it's own randomized item and value of currency to be used in each problem. Students will then be navigated to the register, where they will calculate the difference between the customer tender and owed balance. The student will then distribute change by dragging out different types of currency out of the register such as coins and bills. The value pulled out of register will appear on the coin sum display and be used to check work and provide feedback.
